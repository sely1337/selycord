Selycord is a fork of Equicord, which itself builds on top of Vencord. We stripped out the obfuscation, cleaned things up, added our own improvements, and kept what works. No bloat, no nonsense.

---

## What's in it

* **Faster startup** — no obfuscation means the client loads noticeably quicker and sits lighter on your CPU and RAM.
* **Auto-updates** — checks for updates in the background on launch and applies them silently.
* **Plugin support** — compatible with the existing plugin ecosystem. Install community plugins straight from Git links.
* **Better audio** — hardware-optimized voice modules for cleaner, louder audio out of the box.
* **Custom styling** — smoother UI, custom icons, and various quality-of-life improvements.

## Installation (Windows)

1. Download **`Selycord-install.ps1`**
2. Right-click → **Run with PowerShell**
3. Follow the steps, restart Discord, done.

## Credits

Selycord wouldn't exist without [Equicord](https://github.com/Equicord/Equicord) and [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord). A huge chunk of what makes this work comes directly from their projects. We're fully aware of that and genuinely appreciate everything they've built — we're just taking it in a different direction. Big thanks to everyone who's contributed to both.
